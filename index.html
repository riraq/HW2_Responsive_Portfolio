              <p>
                My name is Rony Iraq and I am currently attending The Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin with a focus on Web Development. I am working on pivoting my career and exploring the opportunites that come with being a web developer. While I will hope to work for a company, I am happy that I could be a freelancer or start my own business which was almost impossible to do in my previous industry. 
              </p>

              <p>
                I was born and raised in Florida lived in Los Angeles, CA for a year and currently live in Austin, TX. I graduated from the University of South Florida with a Bachelor's degree in Health Sciences in 2012. I worked in microbiology laboratories for 8 years analyzing bacteria and fungi from indoor air samples. I performed other duties as well while holding roles as a Microbiologist, Quality Assurance Manager, Laboratory Supervisor and Technical Manager. These included data entry using relational databases, supervising/training employees, quality control of reports, internal/external audits, discussing technical details with clients, and many other tasks.
              </p>

              <p>
                The ability to use the skills of a developer in any environment is why I want to pursue this, especially after the events of 2020. My fascination with being able to create things with just a computer and knowledge drives me. You don't need highly complex technical equipment or large amounts of capital; a person and a computer can do incredible things and I want to be a part of that.
