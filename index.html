              <p>
                My name is Rony Iraq and I am working on becoming a web developer. I was born and raised in West Palm Beach, FL until I moved to Tampa, FL to attend school in 2008. I lived in the Tampa Bay Area until 2019 when I moved to Los Angeles, CA. I currently live in Austin, TX where I have been living since 2020.
              </p>

              <p>
                I graduated from the University of South Florida with a Bachelor's degree in Health Sciences in 2012. After graduating, I worked in microbiology laboratories for 8 years with a focus on indoor air quality in a variety of indoor spaces. I analyzed both bacteria and fungi, as well as performed other duties while holding roles as a Microbiologist, Quality Assurance Manager, Laboratory Supervisor and Technical Manager. Some of these responsibilities included data entry using relational databases, supervising/training employees, quality control of reports, internal/external audits, discussing technical details with clients, and many other tasks.
              </p>

              <p>
                I am currently attending The Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin with a focus on Web Development. I am looking forward to pivoting my career and exploring the exciting opportunites of web development. While I will hope to work for a company, I am happy that I could be a freelancer or start my own business which was almost impossible to do in my previous industry.
              </p>

              <p>The ability to use the skills of a developer in any environment is why I want to pursue this, especially after the events of 2020. My fascination with being able to create things with just a computer and knowledge drives me. You don't need highly complex technical equipment or large amounts of capital; a person and a computer can do incredible things and I want to be a part of that.
