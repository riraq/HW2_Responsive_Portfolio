        <p>
          My name is Rony Iraq and I am currently attending The Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin with a focus on Web
          Development. I am working on pivoting my career and exploring the opportunites that come with being a web
          developer. While I will hope to work for a company, I am happy that I could be a freelancer or start my own
          business which was almost impossible to do in my previous industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was born and raised in Florida lived in Los Angeles, CA for a year and currently live in Austin, TX. I
          graduated from the University of South Florida with a Bachelor's degree in Health Sciences in 2012. I worked
          in microbiology laboratories for 8 years analyzing bacteria and fungi from indoor air samples. I performed
          other duties as well while holding roles as a Microbiologist, Quality Assurance Manager, Laboratory Supervisor
          and Technical Manager. These included data entry using relational databases, supervising/training employees,
          quality control of reports, internal/external audits, discussing technical details with clients, and many
          other tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ability to use the skills of a developer in any environment is why I want to pursue this. My fascination with creating things using only a computer and knowledge drives
          me. You don't need highly complex technical equipment or large amounts of capital; a person and a computer can
          do incredible things and I want to be a part of that.
