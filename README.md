# Responsive Portfolio

## Description
This repository is used to show my in-progress coding portfolio in order to let other developers review previous work that I have done. It uses HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. It has been designed to be responsive when viewed on different browser sizes and devices.

The main page is the About Me which shows a picture of me and gives a short bio on my past, current and future work as well as some other information.

The Portfolio page will contain my work that I would like others to see if they are interested in the kind of code development that I have experience with. 

The Contact page is a way for anyone to get in touch with me if they would like to communicate directly and get more information.
